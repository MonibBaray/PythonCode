# AirPlaneGame

This is where I host my airplane game by following the python tutorial, this is to get more acquainted with the pygame library!

As of right now, it has its intended functionality of loading in jet, cloud, and missle sprites, and the base logic of the game works (If you touch a missle, the window closes).

# TO BE ADDED:
~~-Score functionality (the longer you survive, the higher your score)~~

-Scoreboard functionality to keep track of the highest 5-10 scores

-Attack functionality so that its not just dodging, but more like a classic arcade game from the 70s or 80s.
